Postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: March 10, 2024, 8:00 PM (UTC-4)
  - End Time: March 11, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC-4)
- **Impact:** 
  - The service outage affected 80% of users.
  - Users experienced intermittent connectivity issues and slow response times.
- **Root Cause:** 
  - A database deadlock occurred due to a misconfigured caching layer.

**Timeline:**

- **9:00 PM:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts showing increased latency.
- **9:15 PM:** Engineers investigated network and server logs to identify potential causes.
- **10:00 PM:** Assumed the issue might be related to network congestion and began optimizing network settings.
- **11:00 PM:** Further investigation revealed database queries taking longer than usual.
- **12:00 AM:** Misled by initial assumptions, engineers suspected hardware failure and escalated the incident to the database team.
- **1:00 AM:** Database team identified deadlock issues and recognized the misconfigured caching layer as the root cause.
- **2:00 AM:** The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the caching layer to prevent deadlock situations.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause Explanation:** 
  - The misconfigured caching layer caused frequent database deadlocks.
  - Deadlocks occurred when multiple processes attempted to access the same database resources simultaneously.
- **Resolution Details:** 
  - Engineers reconfigured the caching layer to optimize resource allocation and prevent simultaneous access conflicts.
  - Additionally, database queries were optimized to reduce the likelihood of deadlocks occurring in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated monitoring for detecting database deadlock situations.
  - Conduct regular audits of caching configurations to ensure optimal performance.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update caching layer configurations to prevent resource contention.
  - Deploy additional monitoring tools to detect and alert on database deadlock occurrences.
  - Schedule regular performance audits to identify and mitigate potential bottlenecks in the system.

By implementing these corrective measures and preventative actions, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages in the future and ensure the continued reliability and performance of our services.
